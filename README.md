![Onion Terminator Yang](./OnionTerminatorYang.jpg "Onion Terminator Yang")

RoboYang is here to automate Andrew Yang. By answering questions in his own words.

This was created in [Twine](https://twinery.org) To edit it online, just load up their [editor](https://twinery.org/2) and the index.html file from this repo. If you know more about twine, please provide lessons or tutorials you found valuable!

I'm not sure how to organize this right now, but I'm open to all kinds of advice.

Some todo items:

{} Figure out how to [MERGE](./MergeProcedure.md) new story paths into this repo

{} Figure out how to [STYLE](./StyleIdeas.md) the pages

{} Get some dope [ART](./ArtLinks.md), maybe like a Yang Terminator that isn't from the Onion

{} Figure out how to [HOST](./HostingIdeas.md) this site in a place that can take the brunt of a social media blitz

{} Figure out how to get this site to go [VIRAL](./GoViral.md)

{} SECURE THE BAG!
